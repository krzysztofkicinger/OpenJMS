          We have managed to sort out most of the issues related to TCP, HTTP 
          and HTTPS. OpenJMS also has improved realtime garbage collection for 
          persistent messages so there is no need to schedule batch garbage 
          collection. 
        </p></div><div class="subsection"><h3><a name="January_24__2003_-_OpenJMS_0_7_4_released_">January 24, 2003 - OpenJMS 0.7.4 released!</a></h3><p>
          This version has substantial changes to the memory management and 
          overall stability and performance of the OpenJMS server. 
          It fixes bugs with the TCP and HTTP connector as well as a number of
          bugs with transacted sessions, QueueBrowser, and IntraVM support.  
        </p><p>
          See the <a href="changes-report.html#0.7.4">Release notes</a>
          for a complete list of the changes in 0.7.4.

          in the 0.7.3 release.
        </p><p>
          This release fixes some problems with transacted sessions and the 
          Queue messaging model. It also has a more efficient implementation 
          of receive() and  resolves some outstanding issues with temporary 
          destinations. Finally it provides a sample configuration file to
          install OpenJMS as a service using 
          <a href="http://wrapper.sourceforge.net/doc/english/index.html">
          Wrapper.exe</a>

        </p></div><div class="subsection"><h3><a name="February_01__2002_-_OpenJMS_v0_7_2_is_now_available_">February 01, 2002 - OpenJMS v0.7.2 is now available!</a></h3><p>
          The latest version once again includes a revamped configuration
          file, which is more coherent and simpler to use. To ease the 
          conversion pain we have provided a utility to convert old 
          configuration files to the new format.
        </p><p>
          The new version of OpenJMS has fixed the intermittent bug with 
          persistent messages and RDBMS databases. It also provides support for
          HTTP and HTTPS connectors to facilitate communication across
          interposing firewalls and NATs. Additionally, the OpenJMS server 
          provides limited support for the configuration of multiple 
          connectors, which could be used to provide both secure and non-secure
          access to the same server.
        </p><p>
          Several critical JMS specification bugs have been resolved, 
          in particular those related to durable subscribers, selectors, 
          and connection factories. We have further developed the 
          CTS (Compliance Test Suite), which now runs some 10000 tests on the 
          OpenJMS server to ensure that we remain compliant with the 
          specification. The CTS is not part of our open source offering but 
          remains crucial to the product's quality assurance.
        </p><p>
          To further automate our testing process we have released a soak test
          framework, based on Jakarta ANT, which can be used to automate 
          end-to-end OpenJMS testing. The framework is used internally to test 
          the numerous combinations of transports and databases. To start 
          using the framework read the README file in the src/soak directory.
        </p><p>
          In the next release we will be looking at improving the number of 
          concurrent connections that a server can support as well as the 
          throughput of persistent messages on RDBMS databases.
        </p></div><div class="subsection"><h3><a name="September_27__2001_-_OpenJMS_0_7_released_">September 27, 2001 - OpenJMS 0.7 released!</a></h3><p>
          OpenJMS v0.7 has increased performance through refactoring of 
          key packages. It is now able to support large number of administered
          destinations and durable consumers (&gt; 10000), with improved resource
          management and new services. SSL support has been added to the IPC 
          connection using Sun Microsystems JSSE implementation. 
          We have also successfully configured OpenJMS to run across the 
          internet with interposing firewalls an NATs 
          between the client and the server.
        </p><p>
          OpenJMS is also more compliant to the JMS specification than ever 
          before. Our JMS Compliance Test Suite (CTS), which is a new project, 
          aims to exercise all aspects of the specification. We are currently 
          on track to achieve 80-90% coverage with the next 4-5 weeks. 
        </p></div><div class="subsection"><h3><a name="Jun_9__2001_-_OpenJMS_0_6_released">Jun 9, 2001 - OpenJMS 0.6 released</a></h3><p>
          OpenJMS v0.6 is a stable and reliable implementation of the 
          JMS specifications. We have introduced in-memory and database based 
          garbage collection, which helps maintain a small memory footprint. 
          The latest version now supports the ExceptionListener facility and 
          automatic client disconnection detection for both the RMI and MIPC 
          protocols. In addition, the MIPC protocol is ideal to embed the 
          OpenJMS client into an applet. This version has resolved 
          many of the bug reports and has improved the server's persistent 
          message throughput. Although, the extent of the changes does mean 
          that we are no longer compatible with earlier versions of OpenJMS.  
          In particular, this will effect users that have an existing database 
          of persistent messages and want to upgrade to the latest version.
        </p></div><div class="subsection"><h3><a name="November_11__2000_-_OpenJMS_0_5_released">November 11, 2000 - OpenJMS 0.5 released</a></h3><p>
          OpenJMS 0.5 is a feature complete implementation of Sun 
          Microsystems' JMS 1.0.2 Specification excluding the XA application 
          server facility support. We have improved the general reliability of
          the (IPC, RMI and IntraVM) servers. In addition, we have extended 
          our RDBMS support by covering Sybase, Oracle, MySQL and Postgres. 
          Selectors have stabilized and performance has improved. This 
          version also supports Topic Hierarchy, part of the Application 
          Server Facility specification, client-server flow control and queue 
          browser. Finally, this version facilitates the deployment of JMS 
          clients inside an Applet.
        </p></div><div class="subsection"><h3><a name="September_13__2000_-_OpenJMS_0_4_is_released">September 13, 2000 - OpenJMS 0.4 is released</a></h3><p>
          OpenJMS v0.4 now includes full support for the SQL-92 
          selectors, as outlined in the JMS 1.0.2 specifications. Through the 
          use of <a href="http://castor.exolab.org">Castor</a> 
          JDO, the persistency mechanism now supports both the JDBM and RDBMS 
          adapters. 
          OpenJMS should now be able to support all databases supported by 
          <a href="http://castor.exolab.org">Castor</a>. 
          Testing so far has only been conducted on Oracle 8i.1.6 and 
          Sybase 12. The testharness has been significantly improved to run 
          through and test all configurations of the OpenJMS server.
        </p></div><div class="subsection"><h3><a name="July_18__2000_-_OpenJMS_v0_3_is_released">July 18, 2000 - OpenJMS v0.3 is released</a></h3><p>
          This release doesn't include many more features over and above those 
          introduced in 0.2.1. It improves the reliability of the TCP 
          connector and general stability of the product. It also extends the 
          test coverage of the JMS client. Finally, this release, includes all
          the code required to support SQL-92 selectors, as outlined in the JMS
          1.0.2 specifications (thanks to Tim Anderson). 
        </p></div><div class="subsection"><h3><a name="June_23__2000_-_OpenJMS_v0_2_1_is_released">June 23, 2000 - OpenJMS v0.2.1 is released</a></h3><p>
          This is an interim release that fixes some bugs in the 0.2 release, 
          introduces a TCP/IP connector and improves the performance of 
          persistent message delivery. It also supports TemporaryTopic and 
          TemporaryQueue objects and extends the coverage of the test harness.
        </p></div><div class="subsection"><h3><a name="June_1__2000">June 1, 2000</a></h3><p>

          messaging models.
